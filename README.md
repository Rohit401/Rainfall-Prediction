# Rainfall-Prediction
Iâ€™ve always liked knowing the parameters meteorologists take into account before making a weather forecast, so I found the dataset interesting. 
This project presents a set of experiments that involve the use of common machine learning techniques to create models that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on the weather data for that day in major cities in Australia.
